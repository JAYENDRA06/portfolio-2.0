Additionally, I <u>developed CMS 2.0 React.js Admin UI and accompanying Express.js API</u> to streamline landing page management. While rewriting the Admin API, I introduced an <u>MVC</u> architecture and object-oriented structure, along with <u>dependency injection to eliminate memory leaks</u>. These improvements, combined with query and promise optimizations, <u>reduced API latency on critical endpoints by an average of two seconds</u>. I also applied modular design principles, <u>cutting down approximately 1,000 lines of code</u> across the UI and API, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. I also worked on <u>Complatform .NET API</u> which consumes User Service to manage and organize users into audiences which can be used to schedule campaigns.",
